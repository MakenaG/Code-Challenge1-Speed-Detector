# Code-Challenge1-Speed-Detector

DESCRIPTION
This is a speed detector program that takes in the  speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
